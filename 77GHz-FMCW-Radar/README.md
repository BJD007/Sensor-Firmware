# 77GHz-FMCW-Radar

Hardware Configuration: The configure_hardware() function sets up the ADC, DMA, timer, and UART peripherals. This is written for an STM32F4 microcontroller, but you would need to adapt it to your specific hardware.
Data Collection: The collect_radar_data() function triggers the radar chirp sequence and collects ADC samples using DMA.
Preprocessing: The preprocess_data() function removes the DC offset and applies a windowing function to the collected samples.
Range Processing: The range_processing() function performs FFT on each chirp to convert the time-domain data to the frequency domain.
Doppler Processing: The doppler_processing() function performs FFT across chirps for each range bin to extract velocity information.
CFAR Detection: The cfar_detection() function implements a 2D CA-CFAR algorithm to detect potential targets.
Angle Estimation: The angle_estimation() function estimates the angle of arrival using phase differences across multiple antennas.
Target Tracking: The target_tracking() function implements a simple nearest-neighbor tracking algorithm.
Output Transmission: The send_output() function formats the detected target information and sends it via UART.
Adaptations for 77GHz Radar:
Frequency-Specific Parameters: Ensure that the range and velocity resolutions are correctly set based on the 77GHz radar system's characteristics.
Hardware-Specific Configurations: Adjust the hardware configuration code to match the specific radar front-end and ADC/DMA setup for your 77GHz radar.
Performance Optimizations: Depending on the processing power available, you may need to optimize the FFT and CFAR processing steps further.

The code provides a comprehensive starting point for developing a radar signal processing chain for a 77GHz radar system. You can further customize and expand its functionality based on your specific requirements and the characteristics of your radar hardware.
